## Local Development

1. Clone the repo to a local folder and install composer dependencies using the following command:
    ```
    $ composer install
    ```

2. From the plugin root directory, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    $ (cd tests/Application && yarn install)
    $ (cd tests/Application && yarn build)
    $ (cd tests/Application && bin/console assets:install public -e test)
    
    $ (cd tests/Application && bin/console doctrine:database:create -e test)
    $ (cd tests/Application && bin/console doctrine:schema:create -e test)
    ```

Don't forget to set your database credentials in the .env file.

### Starting dev server

- Using `dev` environment:

    ```bash
    $ (cd tests/Application && bin/console sylius:fixtures:load -e dev)
    $ (cd tests/Application && bin/console server:run -d public -e dev)
    ```
